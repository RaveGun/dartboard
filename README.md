# dartboard
Manual darts scorer for 501

The inspiration is from the work of https://github.com/InsectEater
But I wanted to have a true board as an input.

Since I am no JavaScript programmer and decided I did not wanted to use the jquery (I had no idea what this is). I reused some of the CSS from the original and did a really nasty patch work.
Now that I am thinking, it would have been better just to replace the number block with the board and would have been easier. Maybe :)

I pushed this to git hub because I did not wanted to email the code or put on stick to copy it from my computer to another.

For me it is good enought. Do not expect any support or changes.
Maybe I will add the feature to show the possible combination for the finish once the remaining points are under 180.
